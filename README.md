## Creative Exercise Bouncing SVGs
- My hosting link e.g. https://creative-exercise-squishycode.glitch.me
- Chose SVG section.
- I used these links to help me create this project. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope/requestAnimationFrame, This link helped me refine my logic when I was stuck https://codepen.io/RobotWizard/pen/rRVKVa
- Instead of having one object bounce around and change colors, I decided to just use bouncing shapes and include a gradient on one shape. My code also includes the ability to pause/play the animation on any frame.
